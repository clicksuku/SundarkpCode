## About the Dataset

Brazil Olist Customers, Sellers and Marketing Data

Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses to customers. The platform operates as a marketplace, where merchants can list their products and services and customers can browse and purchase them online.

And the dataset taken is the public dataset of orders made at Olist Stores. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. This is real commercial data, it has been anonymised, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.

# E2E Pipeline Explained

  * Mage as an Orchestrator
  * Mage DataLoader uses Kaggle API to load the Kaggle Dataset. (Please note Kaggle OAuth Key is required)
  * The CSVs of data is unzipped into the filesystem
  * Pandas is used to ingest the CSV data into GCS Buckets through 'Data Exporter'
  * Data is taken from GCS Bucket and ingested into BigQuery Data Lake through 'Data Exporter'
  * DBT is leveraged to do transformations and generate new tables & views for the Customers, Sellers dimension

# Additional Tools Used

  * DBT Packages - CodeGen
  * DBT Packages - DBT Utils

# High Level Design

# Run against GCP Bucket, BigQuery with Mage Orchestrator run in a docker on the local machine

  ## Pre-requisite Steps

    1.	A Google Project with free tier. 
    2.	Following API and Services needs to be enabled on the Google Project
        1. BigQuery API
        2. BigQuery Storage API
        3. Identity and Access Management (IAM) API
        4. Compute Engine API

          4. terraform plan  -var gcpkey=<Path to ServiceAccount.JSON>
          5. terraform apply  -var gcpkey=<Path to ServiceAccount.JSON>

  ## Clean Up

    1. Destroy the resources created through terraform 
        i. terraform destroy  -var gcpkey=<Path to ServiceAccount.JSON>

  ## Pre-requisite Installs required on the system

    1. Docker.io should be installed and available [Installing Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    2. git should be installed and available [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

# Steps to run against GCP Bucket, BigQuery with Mage Orchestrator run in a docker on the local machine

  - Git Clone the Repository from
      <https://github.com/clicksuku/sundarkp-olist-commerce.git>

  - Goto the <cloned folder>/local 
  
  - Build the MAGE_SPARK Image from the DockerFile

    - Goto the folder in which the 'Dockerfile' is present
    - Docker build -t mage_spark .

  - Create another folder, say **checkLocally** , where the mage pipeline is going to reside and run

  - Copy the Service Account.JSON into the newly created **checkLocally** folder [Generate Service Account JSON](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete)

  - Copy the Kaggle.JSON into the newly created **checkLocally** folder here [How to Generate Kaggle API JSON](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api)

  - Copy the "terraform" folder from <ClonedFolder>/local to **checkLocally** folder
  
  - Change the "ProjectID" and "ProjectName" in variables.tf

  - Run the following commands to initialize the GCP buckets and bigquery schema
      1. terraform init  
      2. terraform fmt
      3. terraform validate
      4. terraform plan  -var gcpkey=<Path to ServiceAccount.JSON>
      5. terraform apply  -var gcpkey=<Path to ServiceAccount.JSON>  

  - Run docker command to initiate mage. In the following, a Mage Project 'skpmagepipeline' is created in the following

      > *<span class="mark">docker run -d -t --name skp_mage_spark -e
      > SPARK_MASTER_HOST='local' -p 6789:6789 -v \$(pwd):/home/src mage_spark
      > /app/run_app.sh mage start skpmagepipeline</span>*

  - Once the docker image starts, login to the bash of the Docker. And move/copy the kaggle.json to /root/.kaggle folder

        - docker exec -it skp_mage_spark bash
        - mkdir /root/.kaggle/
        - mv /home/src/kaggle.json /root/.kaggle/
  
  - Open a Web Browser. Run <http://localhost:6789/>

  - Import the Pipeline as ZIP file, under "New Pipeline" from Git Clone folder - <gitclonedfolder>/local/skpdezolist.zip
  
  - Open Pipeline skpdezolist in Mage Editor Mode

  - CD to *skpmagepipeline/dbt*

  - Copy the skp_olist_data_dbt from the *<Git Cloned Folder>(sundarkp-olist-commerce)/local/* to *skpmagepipeline/dbt*

  - Update the Profile for the DBT Project at skpmagepipeline/dbt/skp_olist_data_dbt/profiles.yml

      - Update the field Project to the ** Project ID ** you have configured

      - Update the ** Path of Service Account JSON** in the keyfile field of Profiles.yml (Please note that this would be the directory from within the docker. Such as /home/src/<Service Account.json>
        
      - Update the ** Project ID ** and ** Schema ID/Table Name ** to the fields local/skp_olist_data_dbt/models/core/schema.yml
        
      - Update the ** Project ID ** and ** Schema ID/Table Name ** to the fields local/skp_olist_data_dbt/models/staging/schema.yml

  - Update the GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACC_KEY_FILEPATH for the DBT Project at skpmagepipeline/io_config.yaml to "/home/src/<Service Account.json>"
    
  - Check the <bucket_name> in each step to ensure that it is the bucket created in the terraform step
    
  - In Mage Step 'gcsbuckettobq', update ServiceAccount.JSON file path in service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file. 
  
  - Run each step in the pipeline
    
  - While running the DBT step 'curious_ronin', first run dbt deps before running the models. (How to do it? Remove the body " --select models/* --project-dir /home/src/mage_spark/dbt/skp_olist_data_dbt --profiles-dir /home/src/mage_spark/dbt/skp_olist_data_dbt". Above, replace 'build' with 'deps'. Run it. Once it is successful, replace 'deps' with 'build'. Put in the body as  --select models/* --project-dir /home/src/mage_spark/dbt/skp_olist_data_dbt --profiles-dir /home/src/mage_spark/dbt/skp_olist_data_dbt. Run now.     

  - The steps as explained about, pulls data from Kaggle, ingests into bucket. Creates Tables and views in Dataset. DBT Models are run to generate new tables.
    
  - Following tables would be created in the BigQuery Schema

# Steps to run against GCP Bucket, BigQuery with Mage Orchestrator run in a docker on the GCP machine

 -  With GCP/Terraform, all the GCP resources can be created.
 -  The Installation script became complex when the loaders, exporters had to be updated to the Mage project created.
 -  To meet the deadlines, used only GCP Buckets, Bigquery and DBT but ran the orchestrators locally.

# Top Issues

- Kaggle initialisation in Mage Data Loader was an issue

  - Conda was installed in Docker.

  - Kaggle and other Python libraries were installed in the Conda Active
    environment.

  - So when Conda was not installed and python libraries were installed.
    Data Loader was able to find Kaggle

- Spark Initialization in Mage Data Loader was an Issue

  - DockerFile was created using
    [<u>https://medium.com/@MarinAgli1/setting-up-a-spark-standalone-cluster-on-docker-in-layman-terms-8cbdc9fdd14b</u>](https://medium.com/@MarinAgli1/setting-up-a-spark-standalone-cluster-on-docker-in-layman-terms-8cbdc9fdd14b)

  - Spark session had to be initialized using ScratchPad as mentioned in
    [<u>https://docs.mage.ai/integrations/spark-pyspark#custom-spark-session-at-the-project-level</u>](https://docs.mage.ai/integrations/spark-pyspark#custom-spark-session-at-the-project-level)

- BigQuery tables had ‘Unnamed:0’ as index column.

  - Spark Read CSV to PD.DataFrame added an index column.

  - Referring to
    [<u>https://sparkbyexamples.com/pandas/pandas-drop-index-column/</u>](https://sparkbyexamples.com/pandas/pandas-drop-index-column/)
    and
    [<u>https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/354943</u>](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/354943),
    following were done to remove index

    - pdf = df.toPandas()

    - pdf2 = pdf.reset_index(drop=True)
