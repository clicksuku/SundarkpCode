Given a list of documents in the format:

Document(metadata={'source': '[source]', 'page': [page_number]}, page_content='[document_content]')

Please complete the following steps:

1. Analyze all documents and extract only **standard credit card decline codes**, **special additional decline codes**, and **fraud decline codes for credit cards** from the text. Ignore any unrelated content.

2. For each extracted code, output the code as the key and its short, clear definition (one sentence) as the value.

3. Print your final output as valid JSON, using the following format:
{
  "01": "Refer to issuer - The issuing bank prevented the transaction without a specific reason",
  "02": "Refer to issuer (special condition) - The customer's bank prevented the transaction",
  ...
}

Only include items that are card decline codes for credit cards. Do not include explanations, lists, or commentaryâ€”just the JSON output.
